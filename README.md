# Getting Started with Quicksell Kanban 

The important points that I would like to bring forward are mentioned here.
### `Responsiveness`
Here I tried to keep the interface similar for all the screens, taking inspiration from various kanban boards for eg. Github that keeps same interface for all the devices.

### `Images for users`

Images for users were not provided to us by API, so I have used another API to call with use of user ID's to get unique picture for them.

### `Scalable`

I tried to make it as scalable as possible by using components, environmental variables to compensate for any changes in backend in future. Also allowed scaling for dynamic changes in data for future. 

### `Readability and client-friendly`

Not only I tried to make code small but as readable as possible, using various components, folders for images, icons, styles etc for easy navigation for someone reading the code.

### `Attention to detail`

I've tried everything I can to lookout for smallest of details from the screenshots provided and implementing it.

### `Font`
The only point I think I was not able to find was proper font style that is used in the screenshots, I have tried various and choose that felt similar but is still quite different from the one used in screenshots.
